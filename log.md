## **Day 6:** February 12, 2020
Today's Progress: A ton of work with Plotly. Box plots, scatter plots, etc. All sorts of different customizations and graph edits. Syntax is more straightforward than pyplot imo

Thoughts: Defintely the toughest day so far. Not only fun but very insightful -- looking forward to more challenges like this :)

## **Day 5:** February 11, 2020
Today's Progress: Analyzed a few different data sets, most notably the BTC price chart pre-current bull market. Lots of full little edits on the charts as well as rolling averages which is new to me.

Thoughts: Nothing notable. Still having fun :)


## **Day 4:** February 10, 2020
Today's Progress: Analyzed LEGO data sets. Made bars scatters and other plots. Once the syntax is semi-memorized it is very easy to manipulate and even guess how unfamilar functions work

Thoughts: Trucking along having fun. More practice with pandas and mpl -- feeling excited to be relatively comfortable in pandas


## **Day 3:** February 9, 2020
Today's Progress: Explored graphing with MatPLotLib, graphing multiple lines, rolling averages, and messing around with graph attributes

Thoughts: A lot of muscle memory, used Google a bit for various syntax issues. Feeling good


## **Day 2:** February 8, 2020
Today's Progress: Did some rudimentory analysis with salaries. Most importantly figured out annotations :)

Thoughts: Lots of refreshing memory and getting more comfortable with annotations. Nothing too complicated.


## **Day 1:** February 7, 2020
Today's Progress: Started with some analysis of FPL stuff with pandas. Gundogan and Martinez still killing me. Is Lingard actually good (besides when he plays Fulham)?

Thoughts: Used mostly existing knowledge and Google assist


## **Day 0:** February 7, 2020
Today's Progress: Set up #100daysofcode repo. Brainstormed projects that interest me 

Thoughts: Excited to start!
