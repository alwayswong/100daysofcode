Today's Progress: Started with some analysis of FPL stuff with pandas. Gundogan and Martinez still killing me. Is Lingard actually good (besides when he plays Fulham)?

Thoughts: Used mostly existing knowledge and Google assist

Today's Progress: Did some rudimentory analysis with salaries. Most importantly figured out annotations :)
