## **Day 13:** February 20, 2020
Today's Progress: More drilling with fundamental concepts. Made a rock, paper, scissors game

Thoughts: Having fun, will resume DS work in about a week after more of these drills

## **Day 12:** February 19, 2020
Today's Progress: Basically just a ton of practice with loops. Captured some of it in this file. Nothing fancy just practice.

Thoughts: Going back to the fundamentals. Realized I need to get crisper on loops so drilling different loops today. Hopefully this will allow me to apply these concepts to Selenium and DS work

## **Day 11:** February 18, 2020
Today's Progress: More Selenium today. Made an automated job application script. It needs more work to accomodate different types of Easy Apply (if there are multiple click throughs) but this is a base version

Thoughts: Very challenging. Finding elements was a bit of a struggle but not too bad. However the logic to run this on a loop is very challenging and something I need to spend more time with. Baby steps.

## **Day 10:** February 17, 2020
Today's Progress: More Selenium today. Getting familiar with the methods before some of the more complex stuff like waiting and automating whole processes.

Thoughts: Fun and tough. Started on a more challenging stuff that I got stuck on. Want to spend more time here and Data Science then figure out where to go from there

## **Day 9:** February 16, 2020
Today's Progress: Switched gears a bit because I got into a rabbit hole with Selenium. Did some basic commands including going to a location, finding data, clicking, typing data etc. 

Thoughts: This one was really fun. I imagine I'll spend some more of my 100 days in Selenium building some more interesting use cases.

## **Day 8:** February 15, 2020
Today's Progress: Lots of work with Seaborn and different graph types (shoutout Bubble graphs). Also refreshing memory with Linear Regressions

Basic Linear Regression Steps:
* Create Linear Regression object
* Create x and y variables to feed into the object
* Fit the regression object with the x and y varibles
* Check goodness of fit

Thoughts: Super super excited to get into more advanced machine learning techniques, but this was a good refresher with some new concepts as well

## **Day 7:** February 14, 2020
Today's Progress: Worked with Numpy arrays. Lots of new concepts that I wasn't familiar with as well as refreshing memory on slicing and image conversions.

Thoughts: Have never went deep with Numpy and this was a good way to start that. Feeling comfortable with the concepts although some of the advanced math concepts will take more time to fully understand should I need them for a project down the line (aka not going to sink too much time into the theory of it)

## **Day 6:** February 13, 2020
Today's Progress: A ton of work with Plotly. Box plots, scatter plots, etc. All sorts of different customizations and graph edits. Syntax is more straightforward than pyplot imo

Thoughts: Defintely the toughest day so far. Not only fun but very insightful -- looking forward to more challenges like this :)

## **Day 5:** February 12, 2020
Today's Progress: Analyzed a few different data sets, most notably the BTC price chart pre-current bull market. Lots of full little edits on the charts as well as rolling averages which is new to me.

Thoughts: Nothing notable. Still having fun :)

## **Day 4:** February 11, 2020
Today's Progress: Analyzed LEGO data sets. Made bars scatters and other plots. Once the syntax is semi-memorized it is very easy to manipulate and even guess how unfamilar functions work

Thoughts: Trucking along having fun. More practice with pandas and mpl -- feeling excited to be relatively comfortable in pandas

Link: [Pandas 4](projects/LEGO.ipynb)

## **Day 3:** February 10, 2020
Today's Progress: Explored graphing with MatPLotLib, graphing multiple lines, rolling averages, and messing around with graph attributes

Thoughts: A lot of muscle memory, used Google a bit for various syntax issues. Feeling good

Link: [Pandas 3](projects/Language Popularity.ipynb)

## **Day 2:** February 9, 2020
Today's Progress: Did some rudimentory analysis with salaries. Most importantly figured out annotations :)

Thoughts: Lots of refreshing memory and getting more comfortable with annotations. Nothing too complicated.

Link: [Pandas 2](projects/Messing around with salaries.ipynb)

## **Day 1:** February 8, 2020
Today's Progress: Started with some analysis of FPL stuff with pandas. Gundogan and Martinez still killing me. Is Lingard actually good (besides when he plays Fulham)?

Thoughts: Used mostly existing knowledge and Google assist

Link: [Pandas 1](projects/FPL.ipynb)

## **Day 0:** February 7, 2020
Today's Progress: Set up #100daysofcode repo. Brainstormed projects that interest me 

Thoughts: Excited to start!

## Backlog Project Ideas
* Automatically book tee times when they are released
* Deep Dive on machine learning techniques
