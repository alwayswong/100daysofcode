Thoughts: We move

Link: [Pong](projects/Pong)

## **Day 37:** March 18, 2021
Today's Progress: Drilling with OOP to make pong work. Got the paddles and ball and bouncing functionality

Thoughts: Certainly a lot of effort to make things easy to follow for someone reviewing code, but probably worthwhile down the line

Link: [Pong](projects/Pong)

## **Day 36:** March 17, 2021
Today's Progress: Pong game, part 1

Thoughts: Didn't have a whole lot of time but made the first steps

Link: [Snake](projects/Snake)

## **Day 34:** March 14, 2021
Today's Progress: Part 1 of creating snake. This one is more challenging and some fun logic

Thoughts: Good challenge here

Link: [Snake](projects/Snake)

## **Day 33:** March 13, 2021
Today's Progress: Another turtle game - wonder how they programmed the races at Angels games back in the day

Thoughts: Keep on keeping on

Link: [Games](projects/Turtle2)

## **Day 32:** March 12, 2021
Today's Progress: More mini turtle games. Basic

Thoughts: Easy, will resume DS route soon

Link: [Games](projects/Turtle2)

## **Day 31:** March 11, 2021
Today's Progress: More turtle logic practice. Love how many answers can get you the same result. All about optimization :)

Thoughts: Fun little GUI challenge with turtle module

Link: [GUI](projects/Turtle)

## **Day 30:** March 10, 2021
Today's Progress: Continued with some basic logic challenges. Similar to Karel stuff

Thoughts: Need to plan out the day's challenges better

Link: [GUI](projects/Turtle)

## **Day 29:** March 9, 2021
Today's Progress: Started some GUI building but more importantly the logic behind it

Thoughts: Missed my first day yesterday. Part of the reason is that I haven't gotten clarity on what I want to pursue in the next few days. Will think more about it this weekend.

Link: [GUI](projects/Turtle)

## **Day 28:** March 7, 2021
Today's Progress: Began on some API basics. Simple check for sunset and sunrise and ISS position. Work in progress

Thoughts: Options are limitless once you can comfortably interact with APIs

Link: [APIs](projects/API)

## **Day 27:** March 6, 2021
Today's Progress: Made a few programs including a calculator which is kind of fun and customizable

Thoughts: Onwards

Link: [Functions w/ returns](projects/Functions%20with%20returns)

## **Day 26:** March 5, 2021
Today's Progress: Made a quick game to guess who has more followers. 

Thoughts: Easy Logic - I think I'm getting better at this :) 

Link: [HL](projects/Higher%20Lower)

## **Day 25:** March 4, 2021
Today's Progress: Practice Debugging different issues 

Thoughts: This honestly was not that helpful as Google is basically always the best debugger anyways. Either way, the more practice the better

Link: [Debugging](projects/Debugging)

## **Day 24:** March 3, 2021
Today's Progress: Practice 

Thoughts: Need to get some more deep flow time. Practice is good but just doing surface level drilling recently

Link: N/A

## **Day 23:** March 2, 2021
Today's Progress: Encoder 

Thoughts: More practice with functions.

Link: [Function Practice](projects/Functions)

## **Day 22:** March 1, 2021
Today's Progress: Slowly making progress through functions. 

Thoughts: This is going to help a ton with writing clean code. Excited

Link: [Function Practice](projects/Functions)

## **Day 21:** February 28, 2021
Today's Progress: Working through fundamentals of functions with arguments and parameters. Lots of drilling.

Thoughts: Realized I need to spend some time on writing clean code with functions even if the logic of the functions is more fun. This should help

Link: N/A

## **Day 20:** February 27, 2021
Today's Progress: Create a blackjack game. Very fun application of skills, let's go to Vegas!

Thoughts: Again flow chart (and previous knowledge) was super helpful for creating this game. Reps, reps, reps! We move.

Link: [21](projects/Blackjack)

## **Day 19:** February 26, 2021
Today's Progress: Made a quick guessing game. Probably could be cleaner code if I create defintions but mainly practicing the logic here. Will start to work in best practices moving forward.

Thoughts: Creating a 5 minute flow chart at the beginning is soooo helpful. I was skeptical in the beginning but will be doing this before any coding I do from here on out.

Link: [Guessing Game](projects/Scope)

## **Day 18:** February 25, 2021
Today's Progress: A few functions and mini games that were fun to make. Most notably, a program that take a bunch of bidders and bids and output the highest bidder

Thoughts: Fairly easy challenge (wouldn't have said that a few weeks ago). Excited to keep psuhing.

Link: [Bidding Game](projects/dictionaries)

## **Day 17:** February 24, 2021
Today's Progress: Deep dive with nuances of dictionaries -- should be very helpful for DS work. No discernible output today

Thoughts: More learning :)

Link: N/A

## **Day 16:** February 23, 2021
Today's Progress: Mini game of hangman for old times sake

Thoughts: Happy I decided to go back to the basics with loops and control flow. Feeling much more comfortable even after a few extra days of practice

Link: [Hangman](projects/Hangman)

## **Day 15:** February 22, 2021
Today's Progress: This was an easy one. Redoing the coffee machine with OOP which simplifies the code a lot

Thoughts: I can see how OOP is helpful although its not nearly as fun as the actual logic creation. I'm sure that'll change as I write more and more.

Link: [OOP Coffee Machine](projects/Coffee)

## **Day 14:** February 21, 2021
Today's Progress: Built a coffee machine. Fairly straightforward and good practice with indexing and a precursor to OOP work that I also started.

Thoughts: Consistency is key. Every day I'm getting more and mroe comfortable with syntax and concepts - Onwards!

Link: [Coffee Machine](projects/Misc/coffee_machine.py)


## **Day 13:** February 20, 2021
Today's Progress: More drilling with fundamental concepts. Made a rock, paper, scissors game

Thoughts: Having fun, will resume DS work in about a week after more of these drills

Link: [Control Flow Drilling](projects/Misc/rps.py)

## **Day 12:** February 19, 2021
Today's Progress: Basically just a ton of practice with loops. Captured some of it in this file. Nothing fancy just practice.

Thoughts: Going back to the fundamentals. Realized I need to get crisper on loops so drilling different loops today. Hopefully this will allow me to apply these concepts to Selenium and DS work

Link: [For Loops Practice](projects/Misc/Loops.py)

## **Day 11:** February 18, 2021
Today's Progress: More Selenium today. Made an automated job application script. It needs more work to accomodate different types of Easy Apply (if there are multiple click throughs) but this is a base version

Thoughts: Very challenging. Finding elements was a bit of a struggle but not too bad. However the logic to run this on a loop is very challenging and something I need to spend more time with. Baby steps.

Link: [Selenium Linkedin](projects/Misc/Linkedin.py)

## **Day 10:** February 17, 2021
Today's Progress: More Selenium today. Getting familiar with the methods before some of the more complex stuff like waiting and automating whole processes.

Thoughts: Fun and tough. Started on a more challenging stuff that I got stuck on. Want to spend more time here and Data Science then figure out where to go from there

Link: [Selenium 2 - AutoFill](projects/Misc/FormAutofill.py)

## **Day 9:** February 16, 2021
Today's Progress: Switched gears a bit because I got into a rabbit hole with Selenium. Did some basic commands including going to a location, finding data, clicking, typing data etc. 

Thoughts: This one was really fun. I imagine I'll spend some more of my 100 days in Selenium building some more interesting use cases.

Link: [Selenium Intro](projects/Misc/SeleniumIntro.py)

## **Day 8:** February 15, 2021
Today's Progress: Lots of work with Seaborn and different graph types (shoutout Bubble graphs). Also refreshing memory with Linear Regressions

Basic Linear Regression Steps:
* Create Linear Regression object
* Create x and y variables to feed into the object
* Fit the regression object with the x and y varibles
* Check goodness of fit

Thoughts: Super super excited to get into more advanced machine learning techniques, but this was a good refresher with some new concepts as well

Link: [Seaborn](projects/Misc/Seaborn.ipynb)

## **Day 7:** February 14, 2021
Today's Progress: Worked with Numpy arrays. Lots of new concepts that I wasn't familiar with as well as refreshing memory on slicing and image conversions.

Thoughts: Have never went deep with Numpy and this was a good way to start that. Feeling comfortable with the concepts although some of the advanced math concepts will take more time to fully understand should I need them for a project down the line (aka not going to sink too much time into the theory of it)

Link: [NumPy](projects/Misc/NumPy.ipynb)

## **Day 6:** February 13, 2021
Today's Progress: A ton of work with Plotly. Box plots, scatter plots, etc. All sorts of different customizations and graph edits. Syntax is more straightforward than pyplot imo

Thoughts: Defintely the toughest day so far. Not only fun but very insightful -- looking forward to more challenges like this :)

Link: [Plotly](projects/Misc/Apps.ipynb)

## **Day 5:** February 12, 2021
Today's Progress: Analyzed a few different data sets, most notably the BTC price chart pre-current bull market. Lots of full little edits on the charts as well as rolling averages which is new to me.

Thoughts: Nothing notable. Still having fun :)

Link: [Pandas 5](projects/Misc/Gooooooooogle.ipynb)

## **Day 4:** February 11, 2021
Today's Progress: Analyzed LEGO data sets. Made bars scatters and other plots. Once the syntax is semi-memorized it is very easy to manipulate and even guess how unfamilar functions work

Thoughts: Trucking along having fun. More practice with pandas and mpl -- feeling excited to be relatively comfortable in pandas

Link: [Pandas 4](projects/Misc/LEGO.ipynb)

## **Day 3:** February 10, 2021
Today's Progress: Explored graphing with MatPLotLib, graphing multiple lines, rolling averages, and messing around with graph attributes

Thoughts: A lot of muscle memory, used Google a bit for various syntax issues. Feeling good

Link: [Pandas 3](projects/Misc/Language Popularity.ipynb)

## **Day 2:** February 9, 2021
Today's Progress: Did some rudimentory analysis with salaries. Most importantly figured out annotations :)

Thoughts: Lots of refreshing memory and getting more comfortable with annotations. Nothing too complicated.

Link: [Pandas 2](projects/Misc/salaries.ipynb)

## **Day 1:** February 8, 2021
Today's Progress: Started with some analysis of FPL stuff with pandas. Gundogan and Martinez still killing me. Is Lingard actually good (besides when he plays Fulham)?

Thoughts: Used mostly existing knowledge and Google assist

Link: [Pandas 1](projects/Misc/FPL.ipynb)

## **Day 0:** February 7, 2021
Today's Progress: Set up #100daysofcode repo. Brainstormed projects that interest me 

Thoughts: Excited to start!

## Backlog Project Ideas
* Automatically book tee times when they are released
* Deep Dive on machine learning techniques
* 25, 26, DS Deep dive, 37, 38, API and interacting with external software will be helpful for real world applications
* lots of days left to learn!!
